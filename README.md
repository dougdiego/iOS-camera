# iOS-Camera

## Synopsis

This is an simple camera view application in Swift.  Overtime I've found the need to include a camera or a camera preview layer in my app.  Most of the examples out there are in Objective-C or are using old/depreciated APIs.  

## Installation

Clone or download the project and open Camera.xcodeproj.   If you like the code, copy what you need.

## Code Reuse

Much of this code came from: [AVCamManual-Swift](https://github.com/ooper-shlab/AVCamManual-Swift), which was ported to Swift based on Apple's Objective-c implementation [AVCamManual](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/samplecode/AVCamManual/).  If you need an example of more camera control, please look at: [AVCamManual-Swift](https://github.com/ooper-shlab/AVCamManual-Swift)

The camera button is a modified version of [iOS-camera-button](https://github.com/otusweb/iOS-camera-button/)

The icon in this application comes from [Iconmonstr](http://iconmonstr.com/photo-camera-7/)
